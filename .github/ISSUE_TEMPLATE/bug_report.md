## Important Note
As VulnWhisperer relies on ELK for the data aggregation, it is expected that you already have an ELK instance or the knowledge to deploy one. 
In order to speed up deployment, we provide an updated and tested docker-compose file which deploys all the needed infrastructure and we will support its deployment, but we will not be giving support to ELK instances.
